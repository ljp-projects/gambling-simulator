# Gambling Simulator

Gambling Simulator provides a fun way to experience the soul-crushing weight of immense debt, subpar credt worthiness, and crippling addiction, without the real life repurcussions associated with these key apsects of Gambling Simulator.

## What can you do?

You start out with a **$40K loan** from the bank with an interest rate of **14.75% p.a.**, which must be payed off completely **over the course of 3 years**.
You have chosen to pay off this loan weekly, totalling **$334/week** (including fees) for the next 3 years!

The only problem is, after the fees for taking out the loan, **you only have $39.23 in savings**.
It truly is a miracle that the bank approved your loan at such a low interest rate!

* You lack the expertise even for an internship these days.
* You lack the patience to be a delivery driver
* You lack a driver's licence
* You rent a place to live
* Your landlord is no fun
* Your family and relatives are either unwilling to assist or are deceased
* You do not meet the requirements to be benfited from charities

In essence, you are fucked.

But you do have access to your neighbours internet.
And how can you make money quick on the internet? Gambling!
What a wonderful idea with no flaws or caveats!
If random streamers on Kik! (who may or may not have been funded by the gambling conglomerates) can do it, why can't you!

You get into a wide range of games, like online pokies, and... other games within this one!

## Is this a joke?

How dare you suggest that this *educational experience* about the *perils of gambling* be a mere *joke*!.

## Are there **credit cards**?

Of course! How do you think gamblers can afford to gamble so much?

## Is there BNPL (Buy Now Pay Later)

Of course! How do you think gamblers can afford to gamble so much and still maintain a high enough credit worthiness to get more credit cards?

## Does the game have an ending?
